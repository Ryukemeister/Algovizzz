Algovizzz is a sorting algorithm visualizer that helps you understand how an algorithm works behind the scenes by visualizing it. Built using React, it contains six of the most popular sorting algorithms; namely Merge sort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Selection sort and Heap sort. The purpose behind visualizing the algorithms is because it becomes much easier to understand them and brings out the reading to life. And as someone who isn't a formal computer science student, getting a hold of all these algorithms took a significant amount of time and effort. Hopefully, Algovizzz helps in clarifying the concepts behind some of these algorithms. Don't get what I mean?
